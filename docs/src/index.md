# MCMCBenchmarks.jl Documentation

*A flexible package for benchmarking MCMC samplers in Julia.*

## Features

* Flexible: specify factors to vary in your benchmark, such as number of MCMC samples, MCMC configuration, the size of datasets, and data generating parameters
* Parallel: distribute your benchmark over multiple processors to produce efficient benchmarks
* Extendable: use multiple dispatch to benchmark new samplers
* Performance Metrics: rÌ‚,effective sample size, effective sample size per second, run time, percentage of time in garbage collection, MBs of memory allocated, number of memory allocations.
* Plots: density plots, summary plots, scatter plots, parameter recovery plots
