## Sampler Structs

Each sampler is associated with a MCMC sampler struct, which is a subtype of MCMCSampler. In MCMCBenchmarks, we define subtypes of MCMCSampler for three popular NUTS MCMC samplers in Julia: [CmdStan](https://github.com/StanJulia/CmdStan.jl), [AdvancedHMC](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedHMC.jl) via [Turing](https://turing.ml), and [DynamicHMC](https://github.com/tpapp/DynamicHMC.jl).
