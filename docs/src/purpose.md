## Background

Bayesian inference is a flexible and popular statistical framework that is used in numerous fields of science, engineering, and machine learning. The goal of Bayesian inference is to learn about likely parameter values of a model through observed data. The end product of Bayesian inference is a posterior distribution over the parameter space P(Θ|Y), which quantifies uncertainty in the parameter values. Because real-world models do not have analytical solutions for P(Θ|Y), computational methods, such as MCMC sampling algorithms, are used to approximate analytical solutions, and form the basis of Bayesian inference.

Given the ubiquity of Bayesian inference, it is important to understand the features and performance of available MCMC sampler packages. MCMCBenchmarks.jl aims to accomplish three goals: (1) help Julia users decide which MCMC samplers to use on the basis of performance, (2) help Julia developers identify performance issues, and (3) provide a flexible framework for benchmarking models and samplers aside from those included in the package.

## Benchmarking Challenges

One of the challenges with benchmarking MCMC samplers is the lack of uniform interface. Some samplers may require different arguments or configurations because they function differently or are associated with different packages. In addition, models used for benchmarking differ in terms of parameters, data structure, and function arguments. Without a unifying framework, benchmarking MCMC samplers can be cumbersome, resulting one-off scripts and inflexible code. Our goal in developing MCMCBenchmarks was to fulfill this need for a unifying framework.
